## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- uv (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mojeeb2002/Python-Game.git
cd Python-Game
```

2. Install uv if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using uv:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the database:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database named `number_guesser`
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database credentials:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/number_guesser
   ```
   - Or using SQLite3 directly, by replacing the DATABASE_URL in the .env file with:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///database.db
   ```
   and Walaa, you are all set to go!
